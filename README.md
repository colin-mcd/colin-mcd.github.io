Code for my [personal website](https://colin-mcd.com)!

Email SVG created in Inkscape with the following procedure:
1. Create text with email address
2. `Edit` -> `Resize Page to Selection`
3. Open XML Editor (`Shift+Ctrl+X`, or click bottom right corner boxed `<>` icon)
4. Go to part of xml with the style including `font-weight:normal`, set to `300`
5. `Path` -> `Object to Path`
6. Go back to XML Editor, select `<svg:g id="test...` and set aria-label to "redacted"
7. Save. Done!


**TODO:**
- UntypedLambda
- Countability
- SequentCalculus cut-elim implementation
